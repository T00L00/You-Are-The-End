A short and dark story-driven game about a post-apocalyptic survivor, Cason, who needs to deliver a newborn to one of the last human settlements. The road is filled with the infected, and you have a baby who gets frightened easily. Balance stealth with quick movements while also trying to keep the baby calm.
